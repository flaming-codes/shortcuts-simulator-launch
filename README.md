## About

This 'repo' contains the link to a completely editable **Shortcut** for macOS' **Shortcuts**-app. It allows you launch any simulator on your device w/o opening the terminal every time. This is super handy for my use case (testing web apps on various devices), so I thought it might help you, too!

## Prerequisites

- macOS 12 or higher
- Xcode is installed and has been started at least once

## Usage

Simply import the Shortcut [from this iCloud-link](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/66145786beef4bb98cd4ffa927f542c8). That's it! You can also run the shortcut from the Menu Bar.

## Privacy

This automation uses JavaScript to parse the terminal's raw output as input. You don't need to run it as admin. No data other than the terminal's inital output of available simulators is used.
